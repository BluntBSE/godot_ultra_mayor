When a battle occurs, the player enters the field with a number of decks equal to the number of pilots who acquired

Players have an energy total that is modified by the pilots in play, and by some cards that are played.

The cycle of play is:
	(Will the first round be different?)
	1. Kaiju cards are played from the Kaiju decks and visible targets are assigned.
	2. The player places cards onto the mat (which can also be instants) and assigns targets. Resolutions occur in order of:
		On play - Kaiju (The presence of these cards affects the environment while they're on the bench')
		Instant (Card is consumed, can't be taken back)
		On play (Affects the environment when placed on the mat, but can be put back to hand)
		On resolve - Player (When the player ends their turn,  player cards do things first)
		On resolve - Kaiju (Finally, Kaiju effects affect whatever they are currently targeting.)
